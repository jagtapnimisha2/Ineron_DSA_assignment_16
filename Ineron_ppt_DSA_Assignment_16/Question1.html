  <!--**Question 1**

Given an array, for each element find the value of the nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than that of the current element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value ‘-1’.
Example:-Input: a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Output : [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]

Explanation:
Given array a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
Frequency of each element is: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3

Lets calls Next Greater Frequency element as NGF
1. For element a[0] = 1 which has a frequency = 3,
   As it has frequency of 3 and no other next element
   has frequency more than 3 so  '-1'
2. For element a[1] = 1 it will be -1 same logic
   like a[0]
3. For element a[2] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6  with frequency
   of 3 > 2
4. For element a[3] = 3 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
5. For element a[4] = 4 which has frequency = 1,
   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
   of 2 > 1
6. For element a[5] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
   NGF element is 1 at position = 6 with frequency
   of 3 > 2
7. For element a[6] = 1 there is no element to its
   right, hence -1
